# Manual_Loader
I have developed a manual loader that can be integrated with malware to facilitate injection into a specific process. The manual loader allows the injected malware to execute its code from the InjectionEntryPoint() function in the memory space of the targeted process.

The loader can be added to the malware's code and customized to specify the desired process for injection. Once the loader is executed, it locates the target process and uses appropriate techniques to inject the malware into its memory space. The InjectionEntryPoint() function within the malware is then executed within the targeted process, allowing it to run within that process's context.

It should be noted that this loader is intended for educational purposes only and should not be used to cause harm or engage in any illegal activities. Any use of this tool for malicious purposes is strictly prohibited.
